* **Mind Uploading: Theory and Practice** (à la Splash)
* **The Mathematics of Physics-Based CS** (à la [Olympus](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10201252417731179&set=t.15205765&type=3&theater))
* **New Math** (à la TEDx Montreal)
* **How davidad Thinks About Math: Calculus** (just made that up)
* **Linear Algebra Drawn Right** ;) (à la [slides from RC](http://davidad.github.io/blog/2014/03/10/how-i-think-about-math-relations/))
* **How davidad Thinks About Math: Probability** (ugh sorry the title sucks, titles are hard)
* **Forecasting: Theory and Code** (à la [this repo](https://github.com/davidad/forecasting))
* [**Systems Past: the only 8 software innovations we actually use**](http://davidad.github.io/blog/2014/03/12/the-operating-system-is-out-of-date/) (à la this post)
* **History of Computers, with a focus on Awesome** (à la Splash)
* **von Neumann: a History** (also made it up)
* **RALA: Neil Gershenfeld Militia Recruit Training** (he he)
* **Entropy & Information Theory: History and Theory** ("; I'm thinking about what you were doing at RC and about the papers Seb sent)
* **Data and Types, Across Levels of Abstraction**  (I'm imagining like going from how stuff is represented in memory to how you write code, how languages are related, how they're related)
* **The Architecture of the Internet: Or, What is the Internet Actually?** (technically Juan was going to do this—well, minus the subtitle—at Olympus and I'm not sure what he meant, but I'm sure you can do an excellent lecture on this topic too!)
    * See also [this blog post](http://igoro.com/archive/what-really-happens-when-you-navigate-to-a-url/)
* [**An OSI layer model for the 21st century**](http://davidad.github.io/blog/2014/04/24/an-osi-layer-model-for-the-21st-century/) (title stolen of course)
* **Git, the Internet, Bittorrent, & IPFS: A Data Structures Perspective** (idk if that even makes sense)
* [**All Boolean functions are polynomials**](http://davidad.github.io/blog/2014/04/14/all-boolean-functions-are-polynomials/) (also [these other](https://github.com/davidad/nodes) possibly totally [unrelated things](https://github.com/davidad/boolean-calculator) that also say "Boolean" >_>)
* **Concurrency: Theory and Practice** (based on [this post](http://davidad.github.io/blog/2014/03/23/concurrency-primitives-in-intel-64-assembly/), I'm thinking like covering basics, how it works in the computer, assembly, and C)
* [**FHTW**](https://github.com/davidad/fhtw) **&** [**FPEW**](https://github.com/davidad/fpew) (although I think they're not actually related, so perhaps let's split them up)
* **Kademlia**
* **Kernels and Virtual Memory** (um no idea what I'm talking about, or rather, [what you're talking about](http://davidad.github.io/blog/2014/02/19/relocatable-vs-position-independent-code-or/) ;)
